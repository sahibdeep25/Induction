# Day 2 of college induction program
Day 2 of the College Induction Program began with a warm welcome from the faculty, followed by an interactive session.
We participated in an English proficiency test — a fun and insightful way to assess our language skills and get a feel for the academic journey ahead!

After the english proficiency, We gave a maths proficiency test  which made us remember all the concepts that we learned in our earlier studies Each question was like a mini puzzle. Some tested our speed.  Others made us slow down and think deeply. 

We had a long break after our both tests . We explored our college in the break time. We went to the cafeteria and had our lunch. 

We had a great session on scholarships which would be very helpful for some needy students. Also we had a great session regarding the intake of food with the right diet plan for the students by Dr Arashdeep Singh . This would help the students throughout their life.

We had a session by some seniors of causmic club . They launched an induction activity . We enjoyed their session and had fun with that activity . We learned some new concepts . we went through some new websites.our seniors made us went through GITHub, a vital tool for version control and collaboration. With their guidance, we set up our first repository, marking an important step in our journey as budding developers. This hands-on introduction was both practical and exciting, providing us with a foundational skill that will be crucial throughout our academic and professional careers. we went through many new things . We learnt basic markdown and started to make a repository. 
The day 2 of the induction program was amazing .
