# Day 2 of college induction program
Day 2 of the College Induction Program began with a warm welcome from the faculty, followed by an interactive session.
We participated in an English proficiency test — a fun and insightful way to assess our language skills and get a feel for the academic journey ahead!

After the english proficiency, We gave a maths proficiency test  which made us remember all the concepts that we learned in our earlier studies Each question was like a mini puzzle. Some tested our speed.  Others made us slow down and think deeply. 

We had a long break after our both tests . We explored our college in the break time. We went to the cafeteria and had our lunch. 

We had a great session on scholarships which would be very helpful for some needy students. Also we had a great session regarding the intake of food with the right diet plan for the students by Dr Arashdeep Singh . This would help the students throughout their life.

We had a session by some seniors of causmic club . They launched an induction activity . We enjoyed their session and had fun with that activity . We learned some new concepts . we went through some new websites.our seniors made us went through GITHub, a vital tool for version control and collaboration. With their guidance, we set up our first repository, marking an important step in our journey as budding developers. This hands-on introduction was both practical and exciting, providing us with a foundational skill that will be crucial throughout our academic and professional careers. we went through many new things . We learnt basic markdown and started to make a repository. 
The day 2 of the induction program was amazing .

# Day 3 of college induction program 
Day 3 of our college induction proram began with the gathering of students in the college auditorum . We were very excited for the session as DR. JASWINDER SINGH , an amazing teacher was arrived in the auditorium for our interactive session. When we began today’s journey with the Mool Mantra, it wasn’t just a ritual – it was a message. In college, you’ll meet people from every background. This reminds us that unity in diversity is our strength. College life brings new experiences. The mantra invites you to face them fearlessly and treat everyone with respect. We closed our eyes and meditated for few seconds. The whole auditorium was quite. After opening eyes, we felt very relaxed and calm . After that Dr. Jaswinder Sir started his amazing session . It felt like a dream for me because he is ideal for may of the students all over the world . He made the session very interesting. He is an amazing personality. The session was quite long but we never felt bored. He has made science and maths to learn easily with the practical knowledge. I will never forget that I was also present in that session.
