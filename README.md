# My Experience - GNDEC

# Day 1 of college induction program

My First Day at GNDEC – A Day to Remember
The first day of college didn’t feel like just the start of classes; it felt like the beginning of something much deeper. We started our day at the college Gurdwara Sahib, surrounded by peace and positivity. The sound of bhajans like “Dhan Dhan Guru Anant Sahib Ji” and “Guru Ramdas Rakho Sharnayi” made the atmosphere calm and comforting. But when “ਤੂੰ ਮਾਤ-ਪਿਤਾ ਹਮ ਬਾਲਕ ਤੇਰੇ” was sung, I actually got goosebumps. It reminded me that no matter what, I am never alone in this journey. After prayers and saying “Waheguru Ji Ka Khalsa, Waheguru Ji Ki Fateh,” we received Kadah Prasad, which added sweetness to the moment.

After this, we walked to Hostel No. 2 for refreshments and got our first casual look at the campus. Later, we moved to the college auditorium for an important session. There, we listened to many inspiring speeches. One speaker told us the history of GNDEC—how the people of Gill Pind donated land and worked together to build this college for future generations. It made me feel proud to be part of such a meaningful place.

A senior professor spoke about why college is a sacred space and why we should maintain discipline and respect. Dr. Harpreet Kaur Grewal gave a motivating talk, asking us to stay away from negativity, stay spiritual, and build self-discipline. Her words felt like advice from a friend, not a formal speech. Our Principal, Dr. Sehijpal Singh, also shared an important thought: Whatever branch you have, respect it and love your field. The chief guest, S. Maheshinder Singh Grewal, shared stories of his family’s strong connection with GNDEC and told us about an alumnis who now works at Boeing. It was truly inspiring!

After a short break, during which I learned about NCC (and secretly wished to join it one day), we were divided into groups and taken to our departments.
This first day was not just an introduction to college—it was a day full of learning, values, and inspiration. I realized that GNDEC is not just a college; it’s a community of people who care, who dream, and who believe in excellence. I will always remember this day as the starting point of my amazing journey ahead.

After the english proficiency, We gave a maths proficiency test  which made us remember all the concepts that we learned in our earlier studies Each question was like a mini puzzle. Some tested our speed.  Others made us slow down and think deeply. 

We had a long break after our both tests . We explored our college in the break time. We went to the cafeteria and had our lunch. 

We had a great session on scholarships which would be very helpful for some needy students. Also we had a great session regarding the intake of food with the right diet plan for the students by Dr Arashdeep Singh . This would help the students throughout their life.

Rajvir Kaur Mam , who was having our chemistry session . We started with an interactive session . Dr. Rajvir Kaur ma’am made the session truly engaging by sparking curiosity about the future of engineering. She didn’t just talk about general knowledge – she asked questions, shared real-life examples, and made us think about what skills will matter most in the coming years. From problem-solving and critical thinking to adaptability and innovation, her words reminded us that being an engineer is not just about technical knowledge, but about being creative, curious, and ready to learn every day. She really encouraged the students to solve real life problems and focus more on the skills than only the theory. 
After her session our seniors we having a peer to peer session with us. That was an amazing peer-to-peer session with our seniors that felt more like a friendly conversation than a formal class. They shared their personal experiences—what worked for them, what challenges they faced—and it was so relatable. The best part? They introduced us to the basics of C++ programming in such a simple and practical way. Instead of just theory, they gave us tips and tricks that only come from real experience. It was motivating to learn from people who were once like us and are now doing great!
After that, we enjoyed a refreshing one-hour break—a perfect chance to relax and recharge. Some of us grabbed a quick snack, others chatted with friends, and a few even explored the campus. It was a fun little pause before diving back into the next session, giving everyone time to unwind and get ready for more learning!
After the break, Dr. Priya Darshini ma’am took us through an incredibly engaging session on Universal Human Values. Instead of just lecturing, she made it interactive by asking us to reflect on our own lives—our aspirations, our concerns, and what truly makes us happy. We discussed the difference between excitement and real happiness, and how harmony within ourselves and with others plays a big role. She explained that happiness isn’t about material things but about right understanding, good relationships, and the right use of physical resources. The session left us thinking deeply about how we can live in harmony at all levels—self, family, society, and nature. It was eye-opening and truly thought-provoking!
